This is a replica of Flappy Bird, built with the PyGame module in Python. I followed a really helpful tutorial on Youtube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZg49z76cLw" target="_new">Clear Code</a>, and you should check it out as well!

There is a .py file, which contains the code for the game, sounds for the game, and an assets folder that contains all the files/graphics/images that are needed for the game.
There's also a jupyter notebook for anyone wanting to try it out, but isn't comfortable with running python files from command line. The code is identical!
